Abstract
========

The Wishbone bus is an open source hardware computer bus intended to let
different logic blocks within an integrated circuit communicate with each other.

This paper introduces a set of memory mapped data structures that allow
designers to describe their own logic blocks.  Thus, for compliant chip designs,
the operating system can enumerate the Wishbone bus inside the integrated
circuits, to load the appropriate drivers, similar to PCI or USB.

The proposed specification is already being used in a set of FPGA based
cards being developed at the Open Hardware Repository. By defining a new bus
type within the Linux kernel, the driver for each board can register as a
Wishbone controller and benefit from automatic enumeration.  The bus controller
can use the information it retrieves to load or activate the appropriate set of
drivers to manage either the whole board or the various peripherals that
are attached to the internal Wishbone bus.

Such a scheme greatly simplifies managing the variety of FPGA binary images,
by allowing automatic division of the problem space. Even when a single
driver is needed for the whole device-set within the internal bus, a standardized
identification mechanism reliefs system administrators from manually matching
FPGA images and software drivers.
