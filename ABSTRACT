Abstract
========

The Wishbone bus is an open source hardware computer bus intended to let
different IP blocks within an integrated circuit communicate with each other.

This paper introduces a specification that allows designers to describe the
IP blocks connected to a Wishbone bus inside an FPGA. This allows for the
automatic detection of the IP blocks within the FPGA at runtime by the operating
system.

This technique has been used in practice in a set of FPGA based carrier boards
being developed at the Open Hardware Repository. A Linux bus driver has been
implemented that supports this specification thus allowing for the automatic
loading of the appropriate set of drivers without any additional information from
the user.

Such a scheme greatly simplifies the design of device drivers for FPGA based systems
and allows for their reuse in multiple designs.
